# Agrarserver

### Prepare
Clone Repository and insert sample geometry shapefiles into `postgis-seed/postgis_data/antragsdaten/`

### Run
```sh
# create network
docker network create agrarserver-main

# start traefik
docker-compose -f traefik.yml up -d

# start container and specify your state. Please name it correct (e.g. Nordrhein-Westfalen and NOT nrw, NRW or nordrhein westfalen)!
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=<state_name> docker-compose up
```
It will take some minutes until all sample data is parsed into the PostGIS DB and GeoServer started. Be patient.

PostGIS seed will print something like `postgis-seed_1  | Postgres seed is done. Bye ðŸ‘‹` and GeoServer will print something like `geoserver_1     | 15-Apr-2019 07:54:13.374 INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in 41872 ms` after startup.

### Use
You can now visit e.g. http://web.Nordrhein-Westfalen.localhost and see all parcels. You can insert polygons or rectangles. Additionally, you can enable layers of other states and see its parcels when the according server is running. You can also insert geometries in other states.

### Scale
In order to scale your services you can run `OMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=Nordrhein-Westfalen docker-compose scale gateway=5` to have 5 running instances of the gateway service.
